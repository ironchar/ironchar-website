# Wahoo Systm "Cadence Builds"

Today I only did Cadence Builds on my Kickr Core, and it feels like it was one of the tougher workouts I've done so far. I feel like my cycling form and posture just isn't that good, because even at 110rpm it felt like I was bouncing a little. But it was still good training, and the last 5-10 mins were also very good training to deal with pain and stick through it, because my ass really hurt and my groin area was numb again, so I'm thinking about getting a bikefitting done, but I wonder how much my planned weight loss will affect my position in the future.
