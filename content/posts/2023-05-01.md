Today was my official first day of my definite plan to do an Ironman in June 2025.

It started by None to Run Week 1 and Workout 1 at 6am in the morning which went pretty well. I've been preparing with jogging for the past 2-3 days already, but those I have done heartrate based and now I decided to switch to time-based None2Run program.

The second part of my workout was 30 minutes of "Recovery Spin" on my Wahoo Kickr, which went pretty decently well, although my butt hurt too much so I finally bought a different bike seat, we'll see how I will like the new one.
My heart rate was mostly in Zone 1 for the first part but the second half it went mostly into Zone 2, which just shows how bad my current endurance level is, but that's okay, that's what I'm training for.
