Whoa, I finally did it and actually published this web site - [https://ironchar.com](https://ironchar.com). I'm using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) which I still need to learn about and get used to, but the basic setup is done, and I will try to improve it over time.

My next step will be to try to include my Strava workouts on this page, probably as iframes.
