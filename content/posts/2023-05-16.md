Today was an easy day, with some strength training:

# Squats

Set 1: 5x25kg
Set 2: 5x25kg
Set 3: 7x25kg

On my warmup I was not happy with my form, and my left knee hurt a little, but it got better on set 1 already.

# Bench Press

Set 1: 5x25kg
Set 2: 5x25kg
Set 3: 10x25kg

# Barbell Row

Set 1: 5x32.5kg
Set 2: 5x32.5kg
Set 3: 8x32.5kg



I realized again, that there is still lot to learn about proper lifting form.
