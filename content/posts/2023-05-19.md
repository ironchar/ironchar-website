# None to Run Week 3 Day 3

Went really well, and my heart rate was back to normal again too, I'm looking forward to Week 4 (even more so to week 12).

# Cycling

My cycle session today was cycling to my bike store and back home with my eBike. It was nice and afterwards I was surprised how many Watts I was averaging both directions, because I realized either those Watts (from my eBIke are way off) or more likely my FTP is probably quite off. I'm already wondering what my Half Monty Ramp Test on 2023-06-10 will say.
