Today I've started my strength training again, which I also haven't done in a while, only briefly in December for a couple weeks but before that not really in years.
And even when I did strengh training in the past 10 years it was usually only for a few months at a time, never really consistently.

I've decided to follow [r-fitness Basic Beginner Routine](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/r-fitness-basic-beginner-routine/) for the next 12 weeks, 3 days a week.
But I've decided to start at zero, and just increase the weight according to the plan.

Today I did workout A and I managed to do:

## Squats

Set 1: 5x20kg
Set 2: 5x20kg
Set 3: 10x20kg

## Bench Press

Set 1: 5x20kg
Set 2: 5x20kg
Set 3: 13x20kg

## Barbell Row

Set 1: 5x30kg
Set 2: 5x30kg
Set 3: 9x30kg

It felt pretty nice and fairly easy for now, but I could definitely tell that my thighs will be sore tomorrow, because I'm not used to squatting anymore.
Also my shoulder flexibility was quite bad and on my first squat set I couldn't get the bar in the right position, but on the other 2 sets it already was almost in the right position, though not that comfortably yet.
