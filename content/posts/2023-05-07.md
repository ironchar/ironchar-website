Today I substituted my planned Wahoo Systm ride with an eBike ride, because it was really nice weather and I plan on getting as many training hours as possible outdoors, because I feel like that's closer to what will happen when I do my Ironman.

It was really nice, although it was hard at times to stay at Zone 2, because I got so slow that it felt weird, despite electric assistance, especially on hills. But at the same time it did feel nice to be able to do hills without 95+% of HR.

Technically I did plan on doing a strength workout too, but I decided to skip it, but in my opinion for good reasons. I'm currently working out in my parents' basement, and my dad and my sister were sick and sleeping, so I didn't want to disturb their rest and made the decision to skip the workout. I also just thought that my plan for the next 765 days probably will have do be changed/adjusted frequently, so I might as well get used to it not always being smooth, and it also was not skipped because I was lazy and didn't feel like it, but just for other reasons.
