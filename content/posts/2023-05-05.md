Today felt quite easy from a workout load point of view. It was only None to Run Week 1 Workout 3 and although I woke up with sore legs, the run went really well and felt nice and ever since my legs didn't feel that sore anymore today.

I'm already looking forward to Week 2 of None to run, where I can see how my body adjusts to longer intervals of running.
