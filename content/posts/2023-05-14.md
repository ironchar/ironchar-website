Today I already felt better, but I still decided to play it more safely and so I skipped the planned Wahoo Systm "Ruta Chingaza" workout.
I think it was the right decision though, giving my body the chance to heal the cold more quickly and not risking anything, because now I think I can just resume tomorrow with None To Run Week 3 in the morning, which I'm already looking forward to.
