Unfortunately during the day yesterday I could already tell that I'm getting a cold, so after through thinking I decided that it's best not to push through, especially because I'm still in the very beginning of my training plan. So my planned Wahoo Systm Workout "Defender" just wasn't done, and I also won't do my workout tomorrow, in the hope that on monday I can resume my workout plan again.
